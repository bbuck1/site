The Mapping Early American Elections team has released maps of county-level elections for Congress's second decade. These maps of election returns for the Sixth through Tenth Congresses add to our maps of earlier Congresses to take our coverage of Congressional elections up through the 1806 and 1807 elections. As before, these maps are accompanied by tables that succinctly summarize the results for each district or state-wide at-large election, and which link out to the [_Biographical Directory of the United States Congress_](http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp).

Preparing these data requiers.

While these maps are the result of the work of the entire [project team]({{site.url}}/about/#project-team), two people did especially painstaking labor in getting these maps ready. Jordan Bratt, a PhD student in the Department of History and Art History, continues 

The _Mapping Early American Elections_ [GitHub project](https://github.com/mapping-elections) includes the data we have released so far, along with the other code produced by the project. If you are interested in the [data repository](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data), you can follow the data preparation progress through commits and issues in GitHub.

Please take some time [browse the maps]({{site.url}}/maps/) that represent early American voting returns for Congressional elections. What interesting patterns will you find?
