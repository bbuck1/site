Districts flip, party affiliations change, and populations and geographies shift. These and other changes are visible in the project’s first release of over 70 maps visualizing voting returns, by state, from the first five US Congressional elections. The remaining Congressional maps will be released in batches in early 2018.

The new [Maps]({{site.url}}/maps/) section to begin browsing by Congress and by state. Some states, like Maryland, saw swings in party affiliations, party competition, and regional voting patterns within the first decade of the United States. Others states, like Connecticut, did not. 
Each map page shows a state map with results for a specific Congress, with voting districts and counties outlined, and color- coded to represent the margin of victory. For example, looking at the first election in Maryland, the state elected all Federalists (green) to Congress, even with a strong showing of support for Anti-Federalist (orange) candidates in Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties. The darker the color, the more votes received by a party in that district. It is then possible for a user to click through to the next Congress, under the “Related Maps” to compare how voting patterns changed from election to election. Once all of the state maps are complete, national maps will be available for larger regional comparisons of voting trends during this era. 

Below each map, we provide a table of data that lists election returns by district (or at-large), candidate, party, vote total, percentage of votes earned. To clearly identify the winners, each elected candidate receives a checkmark at the end of their row of data. There are cases when a candidate won the election, but did not serve in Congress. For the purposes of this project, we are highlighting who was elected. For each winner who served in Congress, we provide a link to their entry in the [_Biographical Directory of the United States Congress_](http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp). 

Making the maps is no easy task. Lincoln Mullen and Jordan Bratt have been working through the data for many months. We are also grateful to project advisors, like Phil Lampi, who painstakingly reviewed the maps before launch.  

The _Mapping Early American Elections_ [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mapping-elections/elections-data) includes the data we have released so far, along with the other code produced by the project. If you are interested in the data, you can follow the data preparation progress through commits and issues in GitHub.

Please take some time browse the maps that represent early American voting returns for Congressional elections? What interesting patterns will you find?
