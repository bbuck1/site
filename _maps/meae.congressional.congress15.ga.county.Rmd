Georgia elected six Democratic-Republicans to the Fifteenth Congress.

Georgia used a statewide at-large system for electing members to Congress.

In 1819, a [special election](https://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ga.uscongress.special1.1819) was held in which Robert Raymond Reid was elected to replace John Forsyth, who had resigned from office.
