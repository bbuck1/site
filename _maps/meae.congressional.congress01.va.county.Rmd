Virginiaâ€™s first Congressional election utilized a district-based electoral system. Because the state was to seat ten representatives in Congress, the state was divided into ten districts, with each district electing a candidate from their own district. Because political parties had not been fully developed in Virginia at the time, all ten representatives elected were unaffiliated with a party. Three candidates, White from District 1, Brown from District 2, and Coles from District 3 stood unopposed. The other candidates listed did have opponents, but in many districts, insufficient returns make it impossible to report specific vote totals or percentages. In fact, out of all ten districts, only District 5 had full returns. Therefore, we do know that James Monroe lost to James Madison by 336 votes.
