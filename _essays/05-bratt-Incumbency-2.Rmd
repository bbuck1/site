abstract: High rates of congressional turnover during the new republicâ€™s first decades produced a kind of de facto rotation in office, bringing new members with fresh ideas, but also erasing the knowledge and expertise of experienced members. While some incumbent members did not return to Congress at the wishes of their constituents, others chose to leave their seat voluntarily in order to remain at home with their families, or seek other political or economic opportunities.

Unopposed reelections represent an intriguing subsection of incumbency
in the early republic. Of all the congressional elections in the MEAE
dataset, 322 or twelve percent are unopposed elections. 160 of those
elections represent unopposed incumbents. William A. Burwell of Virginia
participated in the most unopposed elections, winning a seat in the 10th
through the 16th Congresses. Burwell was hardly the exception for
Virginia. Nine of the top fifteen representatives with the most
unopposed elections were from the state of Virginia accounting for
fifty-nine percent of the total 75 elections among them. Virginia
accounted for the most unopposed elections and the majority of unopposed
elections took place in the South (Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina,
and North Carolina). The prevalence of unopposed incumbents in Virginia
illustrates both the district-wide support for the individual, as well
as the political clout such a person wielded. These elections also
reflect the persistence of an older form of deferential politics that
was quickly becoming obsolete in a democratizing nation.
